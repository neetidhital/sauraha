		<h3>What you may not like:</h3>
		<p> Mosquitoes at certain times of the year (nets are provided in hotels/lodges) The overzealous hotel touts at the bus park (simply board any jeep that will take you the 3 kms to the village.

		<h3>How long:</h3>
		<p>You might really like the laid back atmosphere and stay longer than you had originally planned. The small village has a few restaurants as Pokhara and Thamel, but local-style eateries as well. There are no asphalt roads here, just dirt/mud tracks and hardly any traffic. Life is tranquil here. You will want to spend at least one day in the national park, and a couple more days to walk/bike around about. Give yourself at least a minimum of three days.</p>

		<h3>When to go: </h3>
		<p>The dry season would be best (November-April) and March would be the ideal time. The daytime temperature is not too hot and the elephant grass in the national park has been cut, allowing for better animal spotting.</p>

	<div>
		<h3>Where to stay:</h3>
		<p>Twenty years ago when Sauraha was a one horse village, the only places to stay were the lodges inside the national park, and these are not exactly cheap accommodation.</p>
